## Description

The TypeScript Short Programs activity consists of 45 concise programs written in TypeScript. These programs cover various concepts such as data types, functions, control flow, arrays, classes, and more. They provide practical examples to enhance your understanding of TypeScript and its features, making it a valuable resource for both beginners and experienced developers.

## Installation

I have organized all the activities in a single folder called "src" for easy testing and execution and the .js files will be saved in the "dist" folder. This way, we can run all the activities with just one command, eliminating the need to navigate to each folder and execute them individually.

To install the project dependencies, you can use either Yarn or npm.

To set up and run the project, follow these instructions:

### Yarn

To use Yarn, execute the following commands:

1. Install dependencies:
   - yarn
2. Execute code:
   - yarn start

### Npm

To use npm, execute the following commands:

1. Install dependencies:
   - npm i
2. Execute code:
   - npm run start
